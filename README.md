This repository serves as the codebase for blackhand.dev, My personal website. This peroject was done in 7 days to serve as both practice and a practical way for others to see my works as well as contact me.

The site is open source, and all the code is freely available to view and copy for their own websites.

### Under the Hood

Blackhand.dev was build using pure HTML and CSS, delivered through AstroJS and published using GitHub pages.

Originally made using only HTML and CSS, I've decided to switch to AstroJS to make content delivery more efficient, as well as to make switching to a dynamic site easier in the future.

## Setting Up Locally

You can download the files as-is and run it using Astro.
